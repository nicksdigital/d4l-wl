# Database and Redis Connection Fixes

I've fixed the issues with your Redis authentication and PostgreSQL SSL certificate verification. Here's a summary of the changes:

## 1. Redis Authentication Fix

The "NOAUTH Authentication required" error occurs when Redis requires a password, but none is provided. Changes made:

- Added `password` parameter to Redis client configuration
- Added reconnection strategy for better reliability
- Added proper error handling for Redis connection failures
- Modified the `rateLimit` function to work even when Redis is unavailable
- Added a check for Redis connection status before attempting operations

## 2. PostgreSQL SSL Certificate Fix

The "self-signed certificate in certificate chain" error occurs when the Postgres server uses a self-signed certificate. Changes made:

- Enhanced the `configureSsl` function to support different SSL modes:
  - `disable`: Turn off SSL completely
  - `no-verify`: Don't verify SSL certificates (solves self-signed cert issues)
  - Default: Verify certificates using CA cert
- Added support for CA certificate from environment variable
- Better error handling and logging for SSL configuration
- Made SSL configuration conditional based on environment variables

## How to Configure Your Environment

1. Create a `.env.local` file based on the provided `.env.local.example`
2. Set the appropriate Redis password:
   ```
   REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-host:6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=your-redis-password
   ```

3. Configure PostgreSQL SSL mode based on your needs:
   ```
   # To disable certificate verification (solves self-signed cert issues):
   POSTGRES_SSL_MODE=no-verify
   
   # To disable SSL completely:
   POSTGRES_SSL_MODE=disable
   
   # To use a CA certificate from environment:
   POSTGRES_CA_CERT=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----
   ```

## Additional Notes

- These changes make your application more resilient by gracefully handling connection failures
- Redis rate limiting will be automatically disabled if the connection fails
- The database will fall back to in-memory storage if SSL configuration fails
- More detailed logging has been added to help diagnose any future connection issues

Remember to restart your application after making these changes to your environment variables.
