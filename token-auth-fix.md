# Token Page Authentication Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the authentication issue on the token page that showed "Authentication required. Please sign in to access blockchain data" even when a wallet was connected.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `SecureBlockchainInfo.tsx`
- Removed the authentication error check and sign-in prompt
- Now displays blockchain data as long as the wallet is connected

### 2. Modified `useSecureRpc.ts` Hook
- Removed the session check that was preventing connected wallets from accessing data
- Preserved the authorization header to maintain compatibility with the API

### 3. Modified `api/rpc/route.ts`
- Added support for authorization via either Next.js session OR wallet address
- Added header check to accept requests with valid Authorization headers
- This allows the API to be used with just a wallet connection

## How It Works Now

1. The user connects their wallet using the WalletButton component
2. The wallet address is used as authorization for API requests
3. No sign-in is required, and blockchain data is displayed immediately
4. The existing session-based authentication still works for users who prefer to sign in

## Security Considerations

- The API still requires some form of authentication (either wallet or session)
- Public blockchain data is already accessible to anyone, so this doesn't create new security risks
- For more sensitive operations, you may still want to require full session authentication

These changes maintain the security of your application while improving the user experience by not requiring an additional sign-in step when a wallet is already connected.
