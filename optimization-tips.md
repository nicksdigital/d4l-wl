# Next.js TypeScript Development Optimization Guide

## Quick Start

1. We've added a TypeScript version of the Next.js config with optimizations
2. Use one of these commands for faster development:
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux:
   npm run fast-dev
   
   # On Windows:
   npm run win-fast-dev
   ```

## What These Optimizations Do

### 1. TypeScript Configuration
- Using TypeScript for the Next.js configuration
- Optimized webpack settings through proper typing
- Relaxed type checks during development

### 2. Development Scripts
- Added new npm scripts for faster development
- Scripts automatically:
  - Load environment variables
  - Set optimization flags
  - Run Next.js in Turbo mode
  - Allocate more memory to Node.js

### 3. Webpack Optimization
- Chunk splitting configuration optimized for development
- Quicker rebuilds when making changes
- Better hot module replacement performance

### 4. Type-Check Skipping
- TypeScript checks are skipped during development
- A separate `npm run type-check` command is available
- All checks still run during production builds

## Performance Tips for React/Next.js TypeScript Projects

1. **Use TypeScript Project References**
   - For large projects, split into smaller sub-projects

2. **Optimize Import Statements**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ Slow
   import { Button, Card, Form } from 'my-ui-library';
   
   // ✅ Fast
   import Button from 'my-ui-library/Button';
   import Card from 'my-ui-library/Card';
   import Form from 'my-ui-library/Form';
   ```

3. **Leverage TypeScript Features Wisely**
   - Use interface instead of type for objects (faster compilation)
   - Avoid excessive type complexity in development
   - Consider simpler types during development, more precise in production

4. **Dynamic Imports with TypeScript**
   ```typescript
   // Use dynamic imports for code splitting
   const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'));
   ```

5. **Type-Level Performance**
   - Avoid excessive mapped types and conditional types
   - Use the Pick utility type for selecting only needed properties
   - Keep type hierarchies shallow when possible

6. **Use Incremental TypeScript Builds**
   - The `incremental` flag is already set in your tsconfig.json
   - This creates a .tsbuildinfo file to speed up subsequent builds

7. **Consider Monorepos for Large Projects**
   - Tools like Turborepo can optimize your TypeScript build

8. **Bundle Analysis with TypeScript Support**
   ```bash
   npm run analyze
   ```

## Monitoring TypeScript Performance

Add this to your package.json scripts to see TypeScript compilation times:

```json
"ts-time": "tsc --generateTrace ./trace --incremental false && npx analyze-trace-typescript ./trace"
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run ts-time
```
