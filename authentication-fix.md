# Authentication Error Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the authentication error in the SecureBlockchainInfo component.

## Error Description

The following error was occurring when trying to access blockchain data through the secure RPC endpoint:

```
Error: Authentication required
    at useSecureRpc.useCallback[call] (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./src/hooks/useSecureRpc.ts:21:23)
    at useSecureRpc.useCallback[getBlockNumber] (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./src/hooks/useSecureRpc.ts:70:36)
    at fetchData (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./src/components/blockchain/SecureBlockchainInfo.tsx:43:17)
    at SecureBlockchainInfo.useEffect (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./src/components/blockchain/SecureBlockchainInfo.tsx:28:17)
```

## Root Cause

1. The `useSecureRpc` hook requires authentication (a valid session) to make RPC calls
2. The component was not properly handling the authentication error
3. The RPC URL configuration may be missing or incorrect

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Error Handling in SecureBlockchainInfo.tsx

- Added proper error catching in the useEffect call
- Implemented separate error handling for each Promise in the Promise.all call
- Added a special UI state to handle authentication errors with a sign-in button

### 2. Enhanced useSecureRpc.ts Hook

- Added more detailed logging when authentication errors occur
- Included user address in the Authorization header of API requests

### 3. Updated RPC API Endpoint

- Added fallback to RPC_URL if BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL is not available
- Added logging of the RPC URL (partial, for security) for debugging purposes

### 4. Added Environment Variable Example

- Created a .env.local.example file with all required environment variables

## How to Test the Fix

1. Make sure you have a valid RPC URL set in your .env.local file
2. Ensure that NEXTAUTH_SECRET and NEXTAUTH_URL are properly configured
3. Connect your wallet in the application
4. Sign in using the authentication system
5. The SecureBlockchainInfo component should now load properly

## Additional Requirements

- The RPC endpoint must be properly configured in your environment variables
- Users need to both connect their wallet AND authenticate with NextAuth.js
