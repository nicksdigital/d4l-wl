# Turbopack Configuration for Next.js

## What is Turbopack?

Turbopack is a Rust-based successor to Webpack, developed by the creator of Webpack. It's designed to be significantly faster than Webpack, with:

- Up to 700x faster updates than Webpack
- 10x faster cold start than Webpack
- 4x faster than Vite

## Configuration Details

We've configured Turbopack in your `next.config.mjs` file for optimal performance:

```javascript
experimental: {
  turbo: {
    resolveAlias: {
      '@': './src',
    },
    loaders: {
      // Custom loaders if needed
    },
  },
},
```

## Current Limitations

Turbopack is still in beta, so be aware of these limitations:

1. Not all Webpack features are supported yet
2. Some Next.js features might not work perfectly
3. Some third-party libraries might have compatibility issues

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter problems with Turbopack, try these solutions:

### Module Resolution Issues

If you see errors about modules not being found:

1. Make sure your import paths are correct
2. Check if the module is compatible with Turbopack
3. Add the module to `resolveAlias` in the Turbopack config

### CSS/SASS Loading Issues

If styles aren't loading correctly:

1. Use the `.module.css` or `.module.scss` naming convention
2. Avoid complex CSS preprocessor configurations

### API Routes Not Working

If API routes aren't functioning:

1. Restart the development server
2. Make sure your API routes follow the Next.js conventions

## Fallback to Webpack

If you need to temporarily switch back to Webpack:

```bash
npm run dev
# Instead of
npm run fast-dev
```

## Further Performance Improvements

1. **Minimize CSS-in-JS**: Prefer CSS Modules or regular CSS files
2. **Reduce dependencies**: Remove unused packages from your project
3. **Use dynamic imports**: For large components or libraries
4. **Optimize images**: Use the Next.js Image component
5. **Smaller JavaScript bundles**: Use tree-shaking and code splitting

## Monitoring Performance

Check the startup logs to see the performance improvements with Turbopack:

```
âœ“ Ready in X.X s
```

If this number is significantly lower than before, Turbopack is working well!
